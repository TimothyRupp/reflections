When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Allows for a certain amount of security from local system crashes.
	Also allows for other persons to have access to your work and collaborate.
	

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This will allow you to control when you add the changes. This would allow others that are working with the file in the remote repository to add their changes before you pull those to your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks--a "branch" of the current branch of the GitHub Repository that is made to the Git Hub repository of the requester.
	Clone--a complete copy of the repository to the requester/
	Branch--creates a new path of develoment from an existing path.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
